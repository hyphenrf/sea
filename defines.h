/* Defines are static values that never change throughout
 * the code. They can't be assigned a new value.
 * It is convention for defines to be in all caps, and the
 * compiler will replace them with their value everywhere
 * except inside strings and in comments.
 * It is also convention to define everything at the beginning.
